DOI: http://doi.org/10.36295/ASRO.2020.231709  \\n1. Introduction : \\n \\n1.1. Background \\nCricket is one of the most followed sports in India. It was originated  in England and recognized \\nglobally in the 19th and 20th centuries. Earlier there was only one format of the game played a ll \\nover the world i.e. Test cricket. Later on, ODI format was introduced in the yea r 1971 and gain \\npopularity with the introduction of the first-ever ODI World Cup in the year 1975. With the \\ntriumph of India in the 1983 World Cup, the game started gaining  popularity in the country and \\nbecame the most popular sport in the nation. Over the years the spo rt saw its transition and \\nemerged with its shortest format T20. \\nThe first official T-20 matches were played between the England County tea ms on 13 June \\n2003. It was named the Twenty 20 Cup(1). The format first recognized on the international platform \\nin the year 2005 when Australia took on New Zealand and defeated the m. This was the first Men ’s \\nInternational Twenty20 match, played on 17th February 2005.This format gained popularity with \\nthe introduction of 2007 ICC World Cricket Twenty20. It was the first official T-20 Cricket World \\nCup inaugurated by International Cricket Council (ICC), played in South  Africa.The tournament \\nbecame so successful over the years that the fifth season of the tour nament held in 2014 expanded \\nto the participation of 16 teams with 3 teams making debuts in the to urnament. India ’s \\nunimaginable victory in the 2007 T-20 World Cup developed BCCI ’s interest in this outlay of the \\ngame which consequently led to the idea of Indian Premier League (IPL )(2).Initially, IPL was a \\npure marketing technique used by BCCI to cash in on a successful w in of the Indian cricket team in \\nthe 1st ever Twenty20 World Cup held in September 2007. But it made its place  in the hearts of \\nIndians in a very short span(3). The business model of IPL constituted the number of complicated \\nprocesses like hard-hitting cricket, marketing, pricing, glamour, and abov e all entertainment and \\nfor this, it is appreciated by all(4). But right from the beginning of IPL, a huge number of peo ple \\nhave condemned it for the head of the future of Test cricket. Many people fee l that the new format ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\chat\\\\Downloads\\\\RAG\\\\data_1\\\\ImpactofIndianPremierLeagueonTestCricketinIndia.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Rana & Bagchi (2020):  Effect of IPL on test cricket     Nov 2020    Vol. 23 Issue 17 \\n \\nAnnals of Tropical Medicine & Public Health   http://doi.org/10.36295/ASRO.2020.231709  \\n \\n has resulted in making the batsman impatient and affected their defensiv e technique adversely(5). \\nAlso, for the failure of team India in the 2009 and 2010 Twent y-20 World Cups, IPL was held \\nresponsible by many fans, veteran cricketers, and critics(6).  \\nThere have been several types of researches conducted in the past on cricket and  Indian Premier \\nLeague. IPL not only helped in increasing India ’s power over world cricket but also how it can \\nhelp in the ascent of new twenty-first-century India. Also how it can help in moving away from a \\nrestrictive request economy to a free market economy with all the escort danger s of speedy \\naccomplishment, high rewards, and creating a potential for contamination(7). IPL has also been \\ncompared with the cell phone boom in the telephone industry and the changes that it brought in the \\ncricket world. The monopoly of cricket boards is decreasing and how it is going to affect Test \\ncricket(8). IPL is not also untouched by corruption. Its 2013 season wi tnessed the Spot Fixing \\nscandal. It created an outcry in the country as many renowned cricketers wer e found guilty and \\narrested by the Delhi Police. In the interrogation, they claimed to have revealed s ome famous \\nnames from the Mumbai film industry, Franchise owners, and finally its underworld link too(9). \\nAlthough there may be many controversies associated with IPL, it ha s also been successful in \\nproducing many finest cricketers who are doing exceptionally well on the international stage. \\nAlthough the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a source of entertainment, it also serves as a portal for \\ntalent scouting for the Indian National Cricket team. Yusuf Pathan, Ravindr aJadeja, \\nAjinkyaRahane, YuzvendraChahal, Hardik Pandya are some of the names w ho got recognized \\nfrom IPL and played for the National Cricket team(10). \\n1.2. Gap \\nDespite the number of researches that have been conducted in the past and have diff erent \\nopinions of people about IPL, whether positive or negative, I feel th at there is still a gap to find out \\nthe impact of IPL on Indian cricket precisely. There is no such research  available related to this \\ntopic. In this Research paper, I have tried to find out what changes IP L has brought in Indian \\ncricket, specifically in Test cricket. \\n1.3. Significance \\nThis research paper would not only help in assessing the current sce nario of the popularity of \\nTest cricket in India but also help in understanding which format of the game is popular among \\nyouth in the country. It will also help in understanding how do people perceive cricket in the \\nnation. The study will also help in examining whether fundamental cricket in  India is influenced by \\nIPL in terms of Techniques and Skills learning. IPL generates huge revenue for the Indian Cricket \\nBoard which ultimately contributes to the Nation ’s economy. So it is important to understand the \\nchoices of people, what do they want to watch, which is their favorite form at of the game. \\nTherefore, the study will help in analyzing the current trend among people and take necessary steps \\naccording to that. The study will also help the coaches in understanding the requirements of the \\ngame and developing measures and training plans accordingly. Cricket is the most followed sport \\nin India and IPL is the world ’s biggest cricket league. IPL generates employment for a huge \\nnumber of people in the nation. So, it is important to understand what ma kes it different from other \\nleagues. This paper would not only help in understanding the unique ness of the game but will also \\nprovide information about the interest of youth cricketers. The uniquene ss of this paper lies in the \\nfact that this would be the first paper on this particular topic. There is no  such research conducted \\nin the past about this topic. The objective of this research is to find out how and what changes IPL \\nhas brought in Test cricket in the country (if any), how do people perce ive cricket in the country, to \\nassess the popularity of both Test cricket and IPL.  \\n2.

Thus, it can be concluded that it is Test cricket which do minates the skills \\nlearning of the people about the game. \\nThe next response of the samples is about their preferred format of cr icket to watch the game. It \\ncan be seen from the results that the maximum number of people (4 0% of the samples) like to \\nwatch the shortest format of the game i.e. T20 cricket. With 31%, ODI cricket is their second \\nchoice to witness the game. At last, 29% of the people can spare their time to watch the oldest \\nformat of the game - Test cricket. It can also be interpreted that because  of lack of availability of \\ntime, people prefer to watch T20 cricket over Test cricket as it only takes 3 hour s to get the result \\nof a match, whereas you have to wait for 5 days for a Test match to get ov er. \\nQuestion number 3 consists of the responses of the samples on the e ffect of large-media \\ncoverage of cricket on their perception about the game. The results clearly s how that there is no \\nsignificant conclusion can be drawn from the responses as 43% of the people accept that large-\\nmedia coverage affects their perception about the game whereas 44% of the peo ple do not agree \\nwith the fact. 13% of people do not have any clue. \\nForth question represents the responses of the samples about whether T20  cricket has changed \\nthe execution of the cricketing skills or not. It can be seen from the table that more than 4/5th (83%) \\nof the population believe that T20 cricket has brought a change in the execution o f skills in the \\ngame. Only 7% of the people disagree with the fact, whereas 10% do not have any clue about that. \\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the inception of T20 cricket has changed  the execution of the \\nskills in the game. \\nThe next question is all about whether professional players now g ive more importance to IPL \\nover domestic cricket i.e. Ranji Trophy. Results of the study explicitly  prove that majority of the \\npeople (68% of the sample size) believe that professional players now give more importance to IPL \\nover domestic cricket. 9% of people denied the fact and 23% of the population is  ambiguous about \\nthe topic. It can be concluded from the results that professional players n ow prefer to play IPL over \\ndomestic cricket. This is also true because players now get a huge amount o f money to play 14-15 \\nmatches of IPL in comparison to the long domestic season of 3-4 mon ths.  \\nNext questionfocused on whether IPL is now considered as a basis for the s election of the \\nNational Cricket Team. It can be visible from the outcomes that 62% of the po pulation believe that \\nIPL is now considered as a platform to make into the National Cricket Team. 1 5% of the people do \\nnot believe so and 23% of the public do not have any idea regardin g that. So, it can be concluded \\nfrom the results that IPL is now believed to be a basis for the selection  of the National Cricket \\nTeam. It is also true because, since its inception, IPL has produced m any talented cricketers for the \\ncountry who have been successful at the international level also.   \\nThe last question consists of the response of samples on whether IP L has resulted in the \\ndeclining popularity of Test cricket in India. It can be seen from the results that more than half of \\nthe population (52% of the sample size) agreed to the fact that IPL has co ntributed to the fading of \\nthe popularity of Test cricket in the country. 23% of the people do not believe that IPL is the \\nreason for the diminishing popularity of Test cricket, whereas 25% o f people do not have any clue. \\nThus, it can be concluded that IPL is accountable for the decreasing popu larity of Test cricket in \\nIndia. It can also be supported by the results of Question 2. Presented above which shows that \\nnumber of people who want to watch T20 cricket is 40% which is greater than the number of \\npeople who prefer to watch Test cricket which is 29%.

It \\nshows whether there is a difference in the preference of responses or  not. If the Significance value \\nis less than 0.05, it means there is a difference in the preference of respo nses, and if it is more than \\n0.05, it means there is no such difference exists. It can be seen f rom the results that except for \\nquestion number 2, there is a significant difference in the preference of r esponses for each \\nquestion.  \\nThe results of the study demonstrate that IPL has had a significant impac t on Test cricket. The \\ncollected data based on various parameters clearly shows that IPL has brough t many changes in the \\nperceivedness of cricket which ultimately harmed the popularity of Test cricket in  India. The \\nfindings of the above table support the previous study whereinit was  concluded that the \\nintroduction of IPL could result in the casualty of Test cricket(8).  \\nThere are several studies which have been conducted in the past, also sup ports our argument very \\nwell. The most seasoned and the longest arrangement of the game, i.e.,  Test cricket, which has \\nbeen performed from 1877. On the contrary, Twenty-twenty In ternational (T20I), the littlest and \\nmost youthful organization, began distinctly in 2005. The mass ackn owledgement of the most \\nlimited adaptation of cricket was encapsulated by the accomplishment of the es tablishment rooted \\nIndian Premier League (IPL), which began in 2008. Floated by the accomplishment of IPL, \\nnumerous different nations went with the same pattern. Indeed, a 10-over outlay (T10 League) got \\nICC's endorsement in 2018. The smaller the game, the lower is the time responsibility of onlookers \\nand significantly larger is the opposition. This promotes infiltrate new  nations and, guarantee extra \\nrush. This resulted in larger viewership as far as TV, ground and, computerized media onlookers, \\nwhich guarantee extra cash being flowed in. The draw of huge cash allured  cricketers, inclusive of \\nmaturing ones, grasp T-20 position. Indeed, settled players are resigni ng from Test cricket to \\nextend their T-20 vocation(11). This also ties well with our results shown in table 1, where it was \\nconcluded that professional players now prefer to play IPL over domes tic cricket. Also, this \\nsupports our findings presentedintable 1 in the sense that the maj ority of people now prefer to \\nwatch T20 cricket over Test cricket. Cash will lead to the player ’s conduct and decisions(8). This \\nalso has ultimately resulted in the execution of the changing skills of the game.  Our findings have \\nclearly show n that IPL is despoiling the beauty of Test cricket and Young players have  lost the \\ninterest and zeal to play the game. This is because they are getting allured b y the huge money that \\nIPL offers(12). And as a result, now, the selection of a player in the national cricket team is n ot \\npurely based on his performance in the domestic season, IPL has chang ed the system(13). This \\nsupports our findings that IPL is now considered as a basis for th e selection of the national cricket \\nteam.  \\nCricket is gigantically well known in India to the degree that different games f requently get just \\npassing notice in the nation. In a long time after its initiation, IPL has gotte n one of the world \\ngames' chief competencies. Starting in 2010, IPL had a total value of $4 .13 billion and was the 2nd \\nmost lucrative group on the planet. While the IPL, in its short life exp ectancy, indicated enormous \\ndevelopment, the notoriety of cricket alone couldn't have resulted in the success  of IPL(14). \\nNevertheless, the administration problems and the concerning scandals in IPL  uncover various \\nalarming ends and the requirement for genuine changes(15).  \\nHowever, IPL has some positive effects also, it fits into the ascent o f an advanced twenty-first-\\ncentury India. The achievement of the Indian Premier League isn't just about the control of India \\non global cricket, this is likewise about the ascent of India. It is abo ut the move away from a \\nprohibitive order economy to a free market economy with all the escort ris ks of snappy \\naccomplishment, high rewards and, developing potential for debasement(7).

But this also has a contrary impact on the \\nlongest format of the game as numerous Test matches are getting over excessively early and \\ntherefore, the format is becoming more predictable(16).  \\nTo sum up, we can say that our findings are very well suppo rted by previous studies related to \\nour topic. Hence, we can conclude that the Indian Premier League has adv ersely affected Test \\ncricket in the country. \\nHowever, the data collected for the study is based on a small sample of play ers not playing at \\nthe international or IPL level. A major source of limitation of this p aper is due to the \\nunapproachability of BCCI and professional players playing in IPL. To obtain more precise \\nconclusions, it is suggested that such future research studies may be und ertaken on larger and more \\nrelevant samples. \\n4. Conclusion : \\nThe objective of the study was to find the impact of IPL on test cricket in India. The study \\nclearly shows that IPL has negatively impacted Test cricket in India. IPL  has now also become a \\nbasis for selection of the National Cricket Team, because of which players n ow want to play IPL \\nover domestic cricket. As a result, skills execution of the game is changing constantly which has \\nultimately resulted in the declining popularity of Test cricket in the country. The outcome of the \\nstudy will help in developing measures to mitigate the declining popular ity of Test cricket and \\nmake the longest format of the game more interesting. The game is becom ing more dynamic and \\nfast with the infusion of huge money and glamour, hence, it bec omes important to preserve the \\nheritage and glorious history of Test cricket. The proposed research on the to pic would be the first \\nattempt of its kind and it would also help cricket coaches and trainers to design inter esting and \\nenjoyable training programs for players considering the importance of  Test cricket. It would also \\nhelp cricket associations and administrative boards to develop future policies f or cricket and \\nmaintaining the growth of the game in the country.  \\nEthical Clearance : Not applicable \\nSource of Funding : Self-funded \\nConflict of Interest : There is no conflict of interest among the authors \\n \\nReferences : \\n1.
